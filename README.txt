For my project, you need to install cv2, numpy, scikit-learn(sklearn), pickle, os, sys, and pillow. 

To run my program, take the pickled version and run it using 'python2.7 loadImg.py [filename.jpg]'. As the 2nd command line arg, enter one image of the form 'image.jpg' and make sure it is in the same folder as my program. Then it will predict which of the five classifications your image is by printing out one of the five strings the program is expected to take into consideration.

You can also run my proj3.py file which is the file that trains my data set. It will print out the percent accuracy of that training session as well as run 10 validation sets for you (images not included in training). This can be run with the command 'python2.7 proj3.py' and it takes a while to print out the results so just be patient please :)
